## Description

Better Time Warp adds the ability to customise your time warp.

It has many of the same features as [Time Control](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/62946-025-time-control-92314-v132/#comment-954972), and [WarpUnlocker](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/58862-102-warpunlocker-v1-faster-time-warp-no-altitude-restrictions/#comment-878039), but with a stylish UI and customisation features.

### Features:

* Customisable physics and regular (On-Rails) warp
* Lower-than-1 physics warp can be used to help with laggy, high part ships.
	+ It is also pretty good for cinematics
* 0x time warp can be used to freeze time
* Great for ion engines!
	+ 1 hour burn completed in 3 minutes at 20x physical warp.
* Higher warp settings can be used in lower orbits
* Lossless Physics, meaning that you can keep accurate physics simulation even at high physical time warp
* Non-Intrusive UI, which can be disabled using F2
* Can be enabled/disabled in the settings file, without uninstalling or deleting
* Self regenerating settings file
* Persistent time warp selections
* Works in space center and tracking station
* All planets get the same altitude limits for time warp:
	+ 0m for 1-1000,
	+ 100,000m for 10,000x and
	+ 2,000,000m for 100,000x
